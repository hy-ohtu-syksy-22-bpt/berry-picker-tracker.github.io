              <h2>Find your way in the Finnish forests</h2>
              <p>
                The Berry Picker Tracker app is designed to help people who are
                lost in the Finnish forests. Every year, around 15,000 people go
                missing in Finland, and a large portion of them are berry
                pickers. Finding people in the forest is time- and
                resource-consuming, and typically involves the use of drones,
                helicopters, tracking dogs, and volunteer searchers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Berry Picker Tracker app aims to make it easier for people
                to track their location and share it with others. The front-end
                of the app is built with React-Native, and the back-end is
                written in python and running on a virtual machine provided by
                the University of Helsinki. The app uses a detailed
                topographical map provided by the National Land Survey of
                Finland, and has many settings to help users save battery life.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the Berry Picker Tracker app, you can see your coordinates
                and a detailed nature map provided by the National Land Survey
                of Finland. You can share your userID with family members or
                others you want to share your location with, and they can track
                your route from the "Track Route" screen. The app also has many
                settings to help you save battery life.
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently, the app is in internal testing on Android and was
                developed as a university of Helsinki software development
                project.

            <h2>The Course</h2>
            <p>
              The Berry Picker Tracker app was developed as the main part of the
              University of Helsinki software development project course
              (Ohjelmistotuotantoprojekti) during fall 2022. It's a hands-on
              course that focuses on practical experience in agile software
              development. Students work in teams to develop a project from
              start to finish, applying agile principles and practices along the
              way. The course emphasizes the importance of working
              collaboratively, communicating effectively, and adapting to
              change. By the end of the course, students will have developed a
              project as part of a team, gaining valuable experience in agile
              software development.
            </p>
            <h2>The Team</h2>
            <p>
              Berry Picker Tracker was created by six Helsinki University
              Computer Science students.
